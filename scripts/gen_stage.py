"""Generate Kimi-K3 manifests for kern, pipeline stages among them.

A fork of kern's tools/gen_k3.py at kern commit b43bb5a (README,
"Provenance"), which adds the stage (`--layers A:B`), the EP1 prefill MoE on
FlashInfer's routing (k3_moe_bmm.py) and the full checkpoint (`--experts
896`). The rest of kern's tools (the manifest helpers, the kernel index, the
FlashKDA / FMHA / batched-GEMM ABI ports) are imported from a kern checkout at
that commit:

    KERN=<kern checkout> KERN_INDEX_DIR=<kern-kernels>/index \
      python3 scripts/gen_stage.py --layers 23:46 --ranks 1 --chunk 8192 --max-ctx 16384 \
      > manifests/k3-pruned-pp4-l23-46.json
    ... --layers 0:11 --ranks 1 --chunk 8192 --max-ctx 16384 --experts 896 > k3-full-pp8-l0-11.json

Without `--layers A:B` it generates what kern's generator does (the decode
superstep, or with `--chunk N` a prefill-only manifest of layers [0, N)).

Kern's own description of the manifests follows.

Kimi-K3 manifests at EP<R> (the pruned 224-expert checkpoint; `--experts 896`
the full one, prefill at EP1 only): the decode superstep, or with `--chunk N`
a prefill-only manifest.

One SPMD manifest per world: every rank runs the whole dense trunk on its own
batch of sequences and serves its expert shard to the world through MegaMoE
(tools/gen_k3_moe.py). Program `decode`: one token per sequence (`tokens` ==
`seqs`, up to --seqs) through all layers — attention-residual mix, KDA (conv +
delta rule, state in a `bytes_per_seq` line) or absorbed paged MLA (latent
cache in `kv`), latent MoE (router → down-proj → MegaMoE → norm → up-proj,
plus the shared experts) or the dense MLP — then the output mix, final norm,
lm_head and argmax into `next_token`. With `--span-max`, `decode_span` is the
same step in which rows 0..span are one sequence's prompt chunk, its KDA
layers run by FlashKDA over the span (docs/roadmap.md K5).

`--tp R` on a decode manifest makes the tray one batch (docs/multi-gpu.md
"最终形态"): the `tp` group's R ranks each own `tokens` rows and run the trunk
on all `rows` == R * `tokens` rows in the "own rows first" layout (rank r's
rows are rows 0..tokens of every row buffer, rank q's follow at block
(q - r) mod R). The ops that only work on their owner's rows — the attention
with its paged / per-sequence state, the expert dispatch — run on rows
0..tokens; their outputs are all-gathered (tools/kernels-src/peer_collective.cu)
and the rest runs on `rows`. The KDA layers are head-sharded: every rank holds
HEADS / R heads of every row (its slice of every per-head tensor bound by
rank, kernels built for that width, the state line that many heads long),
runs them on all `rows`, and the o_proj partial is all-reduced. The dense FFN
and the shared expert are column-sharded the same way (gate / up rows, down
columns, the down partial all-reduced). Replicated on every rank: the norms
and scoring, the MLA projections, lat_down / lat_up, the router, the LM head.
The caller sets `rows` = R * `tokens` every run (kern does not relate vars)
and leases every row's KDA line on every rank.

`--layers A:B` (with `--chunk`): one pipeline stage of the prefill-only
manifest, layers [A, B) — the stage a PP rank runs. A stage that does not
start at layer 0 takes the stream where the previous stage left it,
`hidden_in` [rows, H] and `blocks_in` [rows, NB_MAX, H] (the attention-
residual snapshots, the first ceil(A / 12) valid), copies them into its
workspaces and runs on; one that does not end at the last layer has no head
and leaves `hidden` and `blocks` (ceil(B / 12) valid) as its outputs. These
are SGLang's PP proxy tensors `hidden_states` and `residual` (the bank),
the bank padded to NB_MAX. The KV and KDA states hold this stage's layers
only. A prefill at EP1 (a stage, or a lone rank) runs the MoE as the tray's
batched GEMMs over every expert, its routing tables built by FlashInfer's
routing kernels (scripts/k3_moe_bmm.py), so the full model's 896 experts fit
where MegaMoE's 224-expert build does not.

`--chunk N`: the prefill-only manifest, whose one program `prefill` runs a
sequence's chunk of `tokens` rows as fed through the layers, the KDA layers by
FlashKDA over the chunk, the MLA layers by the kv_b expansion plus
TensorRT-LLM's context FMHA (docs/k3-kernel-abi.md K13), and the head on the
last row: `next_token` is one token. With `--tp R` it is vLLM / SGLang's TP +
EP with the Megatron all-reduce split into a reduce-scatter and an all-gather
(docs/multi-gpu.md "Prefill-only 的 tray 形态"): the group's ranks are fed the
same chunk; attention runs by heads over every row (each rank HEADS / R heads
of the KDA's and the MLA's per-head axes, the MLA's q_a / kv_a and the latent
cache replicated), and the rest of a layer runs on this rank's block of rows
— rank q holds chunk rows [q * ceil(T / R), (q + 1) * ceil(T / R)), the last
block padded with the chunk's last row; residual stream, router, the MoE,
shared expert and dense FFN with whole weights — with one
`nccl_allgather_bf16` of the normed rows before attention and one
`nccl_reducescatter_bf16` of o_proj's partial after it per layer.

`--dcp` (with `--tp R --ranks R --state-per-layer --experts 896`): the
decode step as SGLang's TP / EP / DCP decode runs it (decode/sglang-tp8-dcp8-
ep8), one batch replicated on the group's R ranks. The KV of an MLA layer is
dealt by position (`kv.<l>` shards `by: position`: position p on member
p % R, kern's schema 7), so every member runs the MLA's q side for every row
and all 96 heads over its own positions (q_a / kv_a, q_b and the absorb
replicated; the append writes through the owner's slot only, the others'
slots point at a pad page), and the members' partials change hands by
heads: fixup, pack, one `nccl_alltoall_bf16`, the LSE combine
(source/k3_dcp.cu). From there a member holds HEADS / R heads of every row,
as it does in a KDA layer (`kda.<l>` shards `by: heads`): v-up, gate and
o_proj over its heads, the o_proj partial summed by `nccl_allreduce_bf16`.
The MoE routes every row through the member's experts — every R-th one from
its index, so the routing's first expert is `{"rank": "tp"}` and the slice a
stride, no rank arithmetic in the manifest — with FlashInfer's routing and
the batched GEMMs, and the routed latent's partial and the shared expert's
(column-split) go through one bf16 all-reduce side by side; the dense FFN's
down partial likewise. Router, lat_down / lat_up, the norms, the embedding
and the LM head are replicated. Every sum is bf16 like SGLang's, so the
residual stream runs on the prefill glue's kernels. `--tp 1 --ranks 1` is
the same step on one GPU holding every expert, with nothing to exchange or
sum: the oracle the group is checked against (step/, scripts/compare_steps.py).
`--layers 2` (one KDA layer, one MoE layer) has no MLA layer and no paged state.

The kernels are kern's own (docs/k3-kernel-abi.md, tools/kernels-src/k3_*.cu):
B is a runtime argument, every launch takes one row per block.x, and the
landing / residual / norm / append work is fused into its neighbours, so a
layer is 8 cuBLAS GEMMs (`extern:cublas_bf16_tn_f32`, f32 partials) plus a
dozen kernels. The launch sequence still follows pegainfer's certified
`k3_step` operand for operand; only the kernel boundaries moved.
